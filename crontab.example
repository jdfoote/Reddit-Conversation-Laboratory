# Example crontab file for Reddit Conversation Laboratory
# 
# This file demonstrates how to schedule the RCL scripts to run automatically.
# To use this crontab:
# 1. Copy this file and adjust the paths to match your installation
# 2. Edit the USER, PROJECT_PATH, and CONDA_PATH variables below
# 3. Install with: crontab your-edited-file
# 4. Verify with: crontab -l
#
# Cron format: minute hour day-of-month month day-of-week command
# Special strings: @reboot, @hourly, @daily, @weekly, @monthly

# === CONFIGURATION ===
# Set these variables to match your environment:
# USER=your_username
# PROJECT_PATH=/path/to/Reddit-Conversation-Laboratory
# CONDA_PATH=/path/to/conda  (e.g., /home/user/miniconda3)

# === SCHEDULED TASKS ===

# Run chatbot every minute with file locking to prevent concurrent executions
# The chatbot checks for new messages and responds to conversations
# Using flock ensures only one instance runs at a time, even if execution takes >1 minute
* * * * * flock -n /tmp/chatbot.lock -c "cd /path/to/Reddit-Conversation-Laboratory/code && /path/to/conda/envs/toxic_talk/bin/python chatbot.py" >> /path/to/Reddit-Conversation-Laboratory/logs/chatbot.log 2>&1

# Run participant identification and modlog collection twice per day (at 6 AM and 6 PM)
# This script scans subreddit mod logs for removed toxic comments and identifies potential participants
0 6,18 * * * cd /path/to/Reddit-Conversation-Laboratory/code && /path/to/conda/envs/toxic_talk/bin/python get_toxic_moderated_comments.py >> /path/to/Reddit-Conversation-Laboratory/logs/modlog.log 2>&1

# Run participant data collection once per day (at 2 AM)
# This script fetches recent comments and suspension status for participants
0 2 * * * cd /path/to/Reddit-Conversation-Laboratory/code && /path/to/conda/envs/toxic_talk/bin/python fetch_comms/retrieve_latest_user_comments.py >> /path/to/Reddit-Conversation-Laboratory/logs/participant_comments.log 2>&1

# === NOTES ===
# - All times are in the server's local timezone
# - Log files help debug issues; create the logs/ directory if it doesn't exist
# - The conda environment 'toxic_talk' must be created first (see README.md)
# - Ensure all necessary API credentials are configured in .env or auth.py
# - You may want to adjust logging levels by adding command-line arguments (e.g., --loglevel info)
# - The flock command with -n flag (non-blocking) prevents multiple chatbot instances from running
#   If the lock is held, flock exits immediately rather than waiting
#
# === ALTERNATIVE USING CONDA ACTIVATE ===
# If you prefer to use 'conda activate', you can structure commands like:
# * * * * * flock -n /tmp/chatbot.lock bash -c "cd /path/to/Reddit-Conversation-Laboratory/code && source /path/to/conda/etc/profile.d/conda.sh && conda activate toxic_talk && python chatbot.py >> /path/to/Reddit-Conversation-Laboratory/logs/chatbot.log 2>&1"
